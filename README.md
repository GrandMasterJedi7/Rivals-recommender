# Rivals-recommender
A still in-progress app that would provide players with the 3 top heroes for the selected role on the selected map.

Still unsure whether or not to use a crap ton of nested if and elif statements or if I want to try to find a API or database that would simplify everything. 
Any suggestions help :)


UPDATE:
I had to add a class/object system as a requirement for the project and Ive attached the updated file. Copilot has helped but I feel I should go in a slightly different direction than what its laid out for me.
IDK we'll see.
